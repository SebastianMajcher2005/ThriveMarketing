                        <p>There is no local business that would be hurt by using Google ads. Every local business in existence would benefit from doing Google ads.</p>
                        
                        <p>Every.</p>

                        <p>I guarantee it.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>BUT.</strong></p>
                        
                        <p>If you're using it you do need to know what you're doing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Because every time I log in to a Google ads account for a new client I see that they're using the dreaded 'Performance Max' campaign.</p>
                        
                        <p>And every time it's performing miserably. Just abysmal results all around.</p>
                        
                        <p>There is a time and place for the Performance Max campaign.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you're not experienced at Google ads... this is not the time nor the place.</p>
                        
                        <p>So instead, just start with the basics. Just go with search. Test some stuff.</p>
                        
                        <p>Trust me on this one. Everything will work so much better.</p>
                        
                        <p>Or ask us to handle it for you. Also a good option.</p>

                        <p>That's been my week. Can't complain because it's mostly good stuff BUTTTTTT it would be nice if I was able to write a newsletter more than once a week.</p>
                        
                        <p>Was thinking about McDonalds recently. Mostly of the fact that it's an actual modern miracle that you can run one of the biggest and most succesful restaurants in the world...</p>
                        
                        <p>...and the people doing it are a bunch of 16 year olds that can't even clean their own rooms!</p>
                        
                        <p>Truly wild stuff.</p>
                        
                        <p>All built on the back of solid SOPs. Standard operating procedures.</p>
                        
                        <p>(Probably same way they used to build the pyramids)</p>
                        
                        <p>They didn't 'time-manage' their way into this. They didn't hire the best people either.</p>
                        
                        <p>They made airtight and rocksolid systems.</p>
                        
                        <p>Good thing to remember when you feel yourself getting into the weeds too much. Check how well your systems hold up under pressure.</p>

                        <p>Most marketing advice really really sucks.</p>
                        
                        <p>I studied marketing for years in school. Then I started my own business. Tried to implement what I learned in school.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was an unmitigated disaster.</p>
                        
                        <p>Didn't get clients. Hardly got anyone to even look at the ads.</p>
                        
                        <p>The ad salesman told me: "yeah, you should run it very often. Veeeeeerrrrrrryyyyy often"</p>
                        
                        <p>Made sense. The guy got paid every time the ad ran. I'd say the same thing.</p>
                        
                        <p>Took me a while to figure out that in university they taught me the strategy that companies like Coca Cola use right now.</p>
                        
                        <p>Just blast your ad and hope for the best.</p>
                        
                        <p>Only issue is that Coca Cola has a 600 million dollar ad budget. And mine was like 600 dollars.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you water a strategy down by a factor of one million it doesn't tend to do as well.</p>
                        
                        <p>Also, Coca Cola has 10,000 people in their marketing department. I had one. Which was me. And I also had to do everything else!</p>
                        
                        <p>So I started to look into the question of: 'how do big companies get so big?'. You don't go from zero to 600 million budget without doing something right... right?</p>
                        
                        <p>After a whole lot of research I figured out that they all roughly use the same formula.</p>
                        
                        <p>They don't start out running mass media 'brand awareness' ads. They start out hammering home a USP and using mostly direct response ads.</p>
                        
                        <p>Coca Cola started out using coupons, forcing distribution and selling a whole lot of sugar water as a result.</p>
                        
                        <p>Turns out that big dumb companies start out as small smart companies. Then they hit critical mass, the board of directors takes over, HR comes on, middle management entrenches itself, there's unlimited budget and the stupidness begins.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now - if you're reading this and you have a $600 million budget - that's awesome. Congratulations, I salute you. Just run any ad, it'll be fine. Wave to me when you fly over Amsterdam in your private jet.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you're not at that level yet, you probably want to make sure your ads have some ROI. So you should check out my report on USPs. It shows you how small, smart companies grew at rapid rates using clever marketing.</p>

                        <p>P.S. No P.S. this time. So it's like Schrodingers P.S. If there is a P.S. that says there's no P.S... is there really a P.S.?</p>

Then, a week prior to the end of the trial, you'll be offered to renew and jump on the retainer. The retainer itself is also cancellable on a monthly basis.
